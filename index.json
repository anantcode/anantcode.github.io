Try running the code by saving it in a file like server.js and run:\nnode server.js The output should be a message saying, \u0026ldquo;Server is listening on port 3000.\u0026rdquo; Stop the server with Ctrl+C and restart it with the following command:\nPORT=9999 node server.js The message should now say, “Server is listening on port 9999.” This means the PORT variable has been temporarily set in front of the node for this execution by PORT=9999.\nHow to set env variable PORT=9999 node server.js\nA similiar way to do this is:\nprocess.env.MY_VARIABLE = 'ahoy';\nboth above are temporary ways\n value is only set during the execution of this Node.js process and only available in child processes spawned by this process. You should avoid overriding environment variables as much as possible and just initialize a configuration variable in your code, as shown in the PORT example (works for PORT because usually in case of PORT, this particular var is undefined usually in all cloud providers, so this way works - gets 3000, or prefers if YOU define something in sys env)  .env files If you develop multiple Node.js projects on one computer, you might have overlapping environment variable names. For example, different messaging apps might need different Twilio Messaging Service SIDs, but both would be called TWILIO_MESSAGE_SERVICE_SID. A great way to achieve project-specific configuration is by using .env files. These files allow you to specify a variety of different environment variables and associated values.\n Typically, you don’t want to checkin these files in source control. So when you create one, just add .env to your .gitignore file.\n because you dont checkin these, you can search and get .env.example - it is shared by others as template file, refer it to write your .env file and and write your values.\nHow do we load the values from this file? The easiest way is by using an npm module called dotenv. Simply install the module via npm:\nnpm install dotenv --save Afterward, add the following line to the very top of your entry file:\nrequire(\u0026#39;dotenv\u0026#39;).config(); This code will automatically load the .env file in the root of your project and initialize the values, skipping any variables already preset. Be careful not to use .env files in your production environment, though. Instead, set the values directly on the respective host. So you might want to wrap your load statement in an if statement:\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \u0026#39;production\u0026#39;) {  require(\u0026#39;dotenv\u0026#39;).config(); } With this code, we’ll only load the .env file if the server isn’t already in production mode.\nLet’s see this in action. Install dotenv in a directory, as shown above. Create an dotenv-example.js file in the same directory and place the following lines into it:\nconsole.log(\u0026#39;No value for FOO yet:\u0026#39;, process.env.FOO);  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \u0026#39;production\u0026#39;) {  require(\u0026#39;dotenv\u0026#39;).config(); }  console.log(\u0026#39;Now the value for FOO is:\u0026#39;, process.env.FOO); Afterward, create a file called .env in the same directory with this content:\nFOO=bar Run the script:\nnode dotenv-example.js The output should look like:\nNo value for FOO yet: undefined Now the value for FOO is: bar As you can see, the value was loaded and defined using dotenv. If you rerun the same command with NODE_ENV set to production, you’ll see that it’ll stay undefined.\nNODE_ENV=production node dotenv-example.js Now the output should be:\nNo value for FOO yet: undefined Now the value for FOO is: undefined If you don’t want to modify your actual code, you can also use Node’s -r argument to load dotenv when executing the script. Change your dotenv-example.js file to:\nconsole.log(\u0026#39;The value for FOO is:\u0026#39;, process.env.FOO); Now execute the file as you normally would:\nnode dotenv-example.js The script should output that the current value for FOO is undefined. Now execute it with the appropriate flag to require dotenv:\nnode -r dotenv/config dotenv-example.js The result is that FOO is now set to bar since the .env file has been loaded.

Need not be EC2 etc.\nCDN is dumb server - which is just a convenient way to say CDN is a server but optimized for file delivery, not for compute.\nindex.html contains bundle.js\nbundle.js contains\n react runtime JSX and Components Routing info Page Layout info  index.html is almost blank - everything in bundle.js\nClient has to execute the JS first, in order to understand what the page is supposed to look like.\nHere the server has minimal role in speeding up your app.\nThe server can only increase or decrease the TTFB (Time to first byte)\nTTBF = HTTP Req Time + time to process Req + HTTP resp. time\nYou can max TTBF here by using a CDN - dont want to use an EC2 instance or a droplet, if using a static website. Better use CDN that is optimized for static file delivery (placed around the world to speed up delivery of your static file).\nHow NextJS works Some of the featues of nextjs require you to have a server running (a live server - running).\n could be serverless, but needs a nodejs process. When using Vercel - that has nextjs-first support - you can put a CDN between Server and client. (You could also you aws with nextjs support - there is a fll blown architecture in aws, aws-serverless-nextjs). But Vercel is more clean.(simple, easy to setup and use)  What if nextjs sends the HTML after rendering it on server?\nGenerate the HTML on server, and send to the client. but HTML\nin React you write\n event handlers functions access window useEffect that runs after component is mounted.  All of this is not available on server! It is too costly to run say puppeteer or some headless browser and render it - so what people do - they wrote a server side renderer for react which is known as reactdom/server\nThis is a package you can also use to natively export the react DOM into static HTML string, which you can then rehydrate.\nre-hydrate rehydrate means - Magically attach all the eventlisteners again! to the static HTML blob.\nThis is where nextjs comes in - it abstracts away all these details of rehydrating and Serverside rendering. On top of it, since it is running on a server, it can give you additional superpowers! which are not present with static reactjs bundle.\nWhat nextjs does As first job, Next JS renders the same page on server that we see in a reactjs app. What\u0026rsquo;s it does that it creates a HTML blob. This HTML document is up and ready for a person to open in a browser - and also HTML is orders of magnitude faster than JavaScript - Means if browser has to render some HTML versus a browser has to run JavaScript that constructs that HTML from scratch, then always the former will be faster. Browsers are very optimised to display the HTML quickly, compared to executing JS. Because JS is a Programming language - it ~has to~ needs to bootup the whole V8 runtime environment, in order to parse the language syntax and do so much stuff.\nHTML on the other hand is just markup lang. - browsers are highly optimized to do this (construct layout) very quickly.\n HTML is very fast compared to JS based DOM rendering.\n If time delay becomes between kindof 50-100ms. It can impact the user experience.\nEven 100-200ms affects UX.\nYou create HTML on server side. Make CDN store the HTML. CDN can deliver files super quickly.\nNodejs is not CPU friendly.\nSSR is slower TTFB because of slow compute of HTML.\nWith nextjs - it is not just SSR - it can also do SSR + revalidate\nRevalidate You render the page with SSR but then put it on CDN. Then you are regenerating the page in background on the server, every 5 secs or say every 2 secs or every 2 mins.\n Why? Because even if your server is slow in regenerating the page completely from scratch, clients dont face the problem because they are served page by fast CDN.\n Any app that doesnt require super real time data - can use this.\n Even if you need real time data you can seperate your View layer from your real time data: client can connect to a websocket that is connected to say aws that can retrieve data - and the main document that serves the page itself can be from CDN. Performance, SEO friendly\n Vercel does need a server running - because of server side revalidation.\nIf revalidate is on, vercel internally manages update - server regenerates, CDN flushes out old whenever there is new copy of the HTML available.\n","permalink":"https://anantcode.github.io/posts/2022-05-16-my-first-impressions-of-next-js-over-react/","summary":"Listing impressions of nextjs from my experience with it so far, and how it differs from react from a devs perspective.\nHow reactjs works: In case of react, on a prod website, server could be a CDN.

Unlike relational tables, collections are self contained, making them much easier to work in distributed systems.\nWhen you create a new Document in mongo - it is assigned a unique object ID - unique to that collection.\nInside that document (document ~ JSON) you can define multiple fields. Each field can be of a data type.\nQuery API is used to work with your data in any language. Query API is used to perform basic read and write operations, as well as to do complex queries and transformations across the database.\nIndex for fast queries Secondary indexes can be created to make common queries extremely fast.\nAlso supports geospatial queries to find all documents near a geographical location.\nIn addition to queries you can also create data aggregation piplines.\nMongoDB is free and can be self hosted. But fastest way to get started is free tier on - Atlas.\nAtlas also launched serverless in Jul 21 - i.e. now benefit of pay per usage.\nAtlas has other essential features like\n Triggers: make it easy to run serverless functions when your underlying data changes.

Upto this point, we\u0026rsquo;re only working with dummy data though (not actually fetching from anywhere) - it is actually hard-coded data\nWe do have this Add New Meetup page here, which would allow users to enter data for a new meetup.\nWe will now add a real backend, with real DB, from which we then fetch it.\nWith this we will also see the last major NextJS feature API routes, which is added by Next to the React apps.\nNextJS makes it easy for us to build an API (a backend API) together with our front-end React app in the same project, using API routes.\nAPI routes are a special routes, (special pages - if you wanna call it like this) which don\u0026rsquo;t return HTML code, but which are instead about accepting incoming HTTP requests, also post, patch, put, delete requests, whatever you need - with JSON data attached to them and which then might do whatever you need to do. For example, store data in a database and then return JSON data.\nSo you could say API routes allow you to build your own API end points as part of this nextjs project.\nAnd they will then be served by the same server as your next app.\nWorking with API routes: Now to add API routes, you add a special folder in your pages folder, and that\u0026rsquo;s a folder named api.\n Just as the pages folder has to be named pages, this folder has to be named api and it has to be in the pages folder.\n Then NextJS will pick up any JavaScript files stored in there and turn those files into API routes that can be targeted by requests and that should receive JSON and return JSON\n file names will act as path segments in the URL. For example, a new-note.js file again, In those JavaScript files here, you then don\u0026rsquo;t create a React component function.   These API routes are not about defining, rendering or returning React components. Instead in there, we will define functions which contains server-side code because API routes will only run on the server, never on the client.\n Decoding them will never be exposed to the client. So we can also use credentials in API routes without compromising them.\nAnd those functions are then simply triggered whenever a request is sent to this route, i.e. /api/new-note here. This would be the URL of this file - a request to this URL will trigger the function which we have to define in this file.\nNow often these function are named handler but the name is up to you, the important thing is that it\u0026rsquo;s exported.\n MongoDB Cluster Tier = M0\nNetwork Access \u0026gt; add IP address\nDatabase Access \u0026gt; create 1 user\nClusters \u0026gt; Connect \u0026gt; Connet your application\nnpm install mongodb\nimport {MongoClient} from mongodb\nin /pages\n create a folder api a js file in /pages/api export a function (name it say handler(req, res))   Make sure the folder is api and not apis etc. Wasted 1.5 hrs details below.\n if req.method == \u0026ldquo;POST\u0026rdquo;\ncall MongoClient.connect (.....) - It returns a promise, so make the handler async, and do await MongoClient.connect(....)\npass the URL of your DB.\nWrite name of DB in URL - if doesnt exist it will be created on the fly.\nconst client = await MongoClient.connect.....\nCollections ~are like tables Documents ~are like entries in those tables\n1 note = 1 document\nOverall a collection holds multiple notes (multiple documents)\nconst db = client.db()\nconst notesCollection = db.collection('notes')\nmeetsupCollection.insertOne({});\n//insert your data here\nconst data = req.body;\n//its async\nawait meetsupCollection.insertOne(data);\nconst result = await meetupsCollection.insertOne(data)\nconsole.log(result);\n//also possible: catch, error handlng in DB collection - not done here.\n//send back a response, using res object\n201 - to indicate that something was inserted.\nres.status(201).json({message: \u0026quot;Note inserted!\u0026quot;})\nSending request to API route from Frontend.

(only the root page for now)\nHollow dot means - only static rendered.\nPossible problems in getStaticProps  in some websites - data could be outdated - because build time done right! no client side data fetching - so can get outdated.  Solution:\n  We can rebuild our site and redeploy WHEN OUT DATA CHANGES - good if data doesnt change frequently like personal blog.\n  If data does change frequently - there is an extra property revalidate that takes in a number (say 10), this number is the no. of seconds NextJS will wait until it regenerates the page for an incoming request.\n  export async function getStaticProps() {  return {  props: {  notes: DUMMY_NOTES,  },  revalidate: 10  }; }  build process will run, but pages wont just generated on build process alone. pages will be generated every couple of seconds on server continuously (if there are incoming requests for the page). The regen. pages will replace old pages.   How many seconds to set? Dependson your dat update freqenmecy\n If yout data changes once every hour - then set this to 3600 If yout data all the time, then 1 sec will be better.  Benefit We are ensuring that the page is ocasionally re-pregenerated on the server and after deployment.\nBenefit: You dont have to rebuild and redeploy all the time just because the data changed - done automatically.\n Other option - SSR with getServerSideProps Sometimes regular update (of page) is not enough. Sometimes our real requirement is to regenerate the page on every incoming request. So you want to pre-generate automatically dynamically after deployment on the server - NOT during the build process, and NOT every couple of seconds\ngetServerSideProps() This is also a reserved name.\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {  return {  props: {  notes: DUMMY_NOTES,  }  }; } This function will not run during the build process, but instead always on the server after deployment. It also returns an object with props key.\nAny code you write here will always run on the server. Never on the client\nYou can also perform operations whcih use credentials, which sould be not exposed to client. We can do it because this code only runs on Server.\nCant set revalidate here - which is obvious because there is no longer need to revalidate because he function gssp runs every incoming request anyway.\ncontext parameter in getServerSideProps() export async function getServerSideProps(context) {   const req = context.req;  const res = context.res;   //fetch data from an API   return {  props: {  notes: DUMMY_NOTES,  }  }; } context param gives access to request and response.\nthe above may look kindof familiar (if you have worked on node, express) (we also get req and res objects in middleware, to then work with those)\nYou can work on authentication (check session cookie) etc.\nHave access to all headers, req body etc.\nUltimately you DON\u0026rsquo;T return response using context.res \u0026ndash; you return only the objects with props key.\nWhich one to use - getStaticProps / getServerSideProps GSSP\n  always updated data - but more time processing every incoming req\n  Use it for data that changes a lot (think multiple times every second)\n  Only 2 reasons to use GSSP -\n You need access to req (not possible ni GSP) Data changes many times a second.  GSP\nIf you dont need access to request object - for lets say authentication - if you dont need authentication, then getStaticProps is better. Because here we pre generate an HTML file. That file can then be stored and served by a CDN - and that is simply faster than fetchnig data + regenerating for every incoming request.

Why emphasing on the 2 render cycle?\nBecause UX affected because (rerender/flickering) - and SEO affected - in the first render, data is not there! - because it is rendered in the second component execution cycle.\nthe prerendered HTML page (generated by nextjs automatically) does not wait for the second cycle - it always takes the result of the first render cycle and returns that as the pre rendered HTML code.\nThankfully nextjs has solution to this: Page Pre-rendering\nPage pre rendering Can use getStaticProps\n reserved name only works in pages/ (components under pages) This executes before the component function is run is allowed to be async.

Any code you write in here will never end up in client side, never execute on client side.  simply because this code is executed during the build process, not on the server and especially not on the clients of your visitors.\nSo the code in here will never reach the machines of your visitors.\nIt will never execute on their machines.\nNow, here in getStaticProps, you can do whatever you want, for example, fetch data from an API or from a database or read data from some files in the file system.\nBut then once you\u0026rsquo;re done with whatever you did to get the data you need, you need to return an object here in getStaticProps.\nYou always need to return an object from gsp.\nNow, in this object, you can configure various things but most importantly, you typically set a props property here and it has to be named props.\nWhat props holds will be the props object you receive in your component function (HomePage(props)).\nThe structure of this props object is totally up to you, (we could have our notes key in there.) which holds our DUMMY_NOTES.\nexport async function getStaticProps(){  //fetch data from an API  return {  props: {  notes: DUMMY_NOTES  }  } }  Therefore in our HomePage() we no longer need to manage state!

In most cases these servers serve to resolve or translate those names to IP addresses as requested (right now there are over 600 different DNS root servers distributed across the world).\n So when we request a DNS lookup, what we actually do is interogate one of these servers and ask to find out which IP address coresponds to the https://example.com name.\nAfter this initial lookup, the IP address will probably be cached for a while, so next visits on the same website will happen faster since there\u0026rsquo;s no need for a DNS lookup (remember, a DNS lookup only happens the first time we visit a website).\nTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Handshake Once the web browser knows the IP address of the website, it will try and set up a connection to the server holding the resources, via a TCP three-way handshake (also called SYN-SYN-ACK, or more accurately SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, because there are three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session between two computers).\n TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets (of data) across the Internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.\n  The TCP Handshake is a mechanism designed so that two entities (in our case the browser and the server) that want to pass information back and forth to each other can negotiate the parameters of the connection before transmitting data.\n   The browser sends a SYNC message to the server and asks for SYNchronization (synchronization means the connection).\n  The server will then reply with a SYNC-ACK message (SYNChronization and ACKnowledgement):\n  In the last step, the browser will reply with an ACK message.\n  Now that the TCP connection (a two way connection) has been established through the 3 way handshake, the TLS negotiation can begin.\nTLS negotiation For secure connections established over HTTPS, anotherhandshake is needed.\nThis handshake (TLS negotiation)\n determines which cipher will be used to encrypt the communication, verifies the server and establishes that a secure connection is in place before beginning the actual transfer of data.   Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor of the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email and instant messaging but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible. Since applications can communicate either with or without TLS (or SSL), it is necessary for the client (browser) to request that the server sets up a TLS connection.\n  Reference: https://dev.to/arikaturika/how-web-browsers-work-part-1-with-illustrations-1nid\n","permalink":"https://anantcode.github.io/posts/2022-04-30-how-web-browsers-work-1/","summary":"DNS Lookup (resolving the web address) The first step in navigating to a web page is finding where the assets for that page are located (HTML, CSS, Javascript and other kind of files)\nIf we\u0026rsquo;ve never visited this site before, a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup must happen.\n DNS servers are computer servers that contain a database of public IP addresses and their associated hostnames (this is commonly compared to a phonebook in that people\u0026rsquo;s names are associated to a particular phone number).","title":"How Web Browsers Work Part - 1"},{"content":"When working on multiple simultaneously open VSCode windows, use Peacock for Visual Studio Code\nPeacock enables you to easily distinguish between and locate different VSCode workspaces.\nYou can set color of your choice for each of the VSCode projects (at workspace level).\nSo you can have different colors for each of your frontend, backend etc. apps.\n keywords:\nmultiple windows in vscode, window management,\n","permalink":"https://anantcode.github.io/posts/2022-04-28-peacock-vscode-extension/","summary":"When working on multiple simultaneously open VSCode windows, use Peacock for Visual Studio Code\nPeacock enables you to easily distinguish between and locate different VSCode workspaces.\nYou can set color of your choice for each of the VSCode projects (at workspace level).\nSo you can have different colors for each of your frontend, backend etc. apps.\n keywords:\nmultiple windows in vscode, window management,","title":"Peacock VSCode Extension - working with multiple VSCode workspaces made easy"},{"content":"My email ID (with gmail) contains. .\nLike ab.cd@gmail.com.\nUsually with Google/gmail it is not a problem - login etc work as usual if I skip the .\nab.cd@gmail.com abcd@gmail.com\nOn Gmail, both are equivalemt.

So better make your hugo-project a git repo first.\n This will create a public folder and populate it with 2nd repo.\nAdding 2nd repo as submodule makes it possible to directly push generated stuff in 2nd repo (that will effectively deploy the site on GutHub pages)\n Build the code hugo -t \u0026lt;name of theme\u0026gt;` example hugo -t PaperMod creates static content (say 10 pages, one sitemap etc\u0026hellip;) in public dir.\n btw if you just check where the origin is pointing to when you are inside the public folder - it will point to the 2nd repo - because you are inside public folder that you created using submodule.\ngit remote -v Deploy site to GitHub Now, cd into the public folder, see the files generated by Hugo, and push them to origin (2nd repo)\ncd public\rgit push origin main Enable Github Pages in your 2nd repo, and see the site live!\nCongrats! you now have a live static-site created using Hugo.\n Thanks to adityatelange for the theme PaperMod that is also used to create this blog.\n","permalink":"https://anantcode.github.io/posts/create-blog-with-hugo/","summary":"Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.

Create a folder images in public also create public/images/posts to store images of your post.\nCreate a frontmatter - it is always at the top In the test md file,\nGet post on homepage from md: getStaticProps() allows us to fetch data at build time - we can use this to create static website - use this to fetch data for static website.\nIn index.js\nexport async function getStaticProps() {  // here data can even come from strapi etc.(any headless CMS)  return {  props: { posts: \u0026#34;The Posts\u0026#34; }, //test  }; } getStaticProps() makes it available in the main component: (here in Home functional component)\nImport fs Although as soon as you add the import\nimport fs from \u0026#34;fs\u0026#34;; You will see error by Next\nReason for the error is - fs is not something you can import on the client side. fs is the filesystem node.js module and we are trying to import it in client side code (react code).\nHowever next.js is smart enough to know that if you use the fs module inside the getStaticProps() which will run on Server Side, then fs will work.\nNo more errors! :) Even if import fs from \u0026quot;fs\u0026quot; is still in code, fs was used only inside getStaticProps() function and hence the error is no longer shown by Next.\n1 = array of all files (names?) on posts directory.\n2 = 3, they are same.\n Create an array that will contain all the slugs. ~15:00 mins in https://youtu.be/MrjeefD8sac?t=895\n(For now there is only 1 test.md - its slug)\nUse gray-matter import matter from \u0026#34;gray-matter\u0026#34;; in getStaticProps()\n// destructring - renaming the data to frontmatter. const { data: **frontmatter** } = matter(markdownWithMeta);  return {  slug,  **frontmatter**, }; Now return the posts instead of test string, from getStaticProps()\nreturn {  props: { posts: posts }, }; we are logging it in component start\nSo for log at line 7, we see:\nwhy array? because its result of map()\nAlso array size = no. of files. We have only 1 test.md :\n Notice that we dont have the body of markdown - we dont need it because we will not put it in index.js but will do in another component.\n Add some more .md files see them getting displayed.\nCreate a component for post, instead of the h3 Added links to Post component\nIt is redirecting to the URL (but getting 404 ofcourse, we dont have those pages yet).\nNeed to work on inner page now. We wants url of the blog page to be like /blog/slug\nSince this is a static site, we need to create these paths at build time obviously. They way we will do that with specific data fetching method called getStaticPaths\nWe wants url of the blog page to be like /blog/slug and slug can be anything. So we have to format the pages like following, for routing:\nSo starting:\n Create a new folder blog under pages/ Create a js file under blog [slug].js It is named with because we want to be dynamic.

All other pages are also rendered by the JS by modifying DOM in the same page(hence Single Page Application)  Client-side rendering means that a website’s JavaScript is rendered in your browser, rather than on the website’s server.\nWhat are the benefits of client-side rendering?  As all the burden of rendering content is on the client (i.e. person or bot trying to view your page), Client-side rendering is the cheaper option for the website owner because it reduces the load on their own servers.  What are the risks of client-side rendering?   Client-side rendering can in general increase chances of a poor user experience. It is because JS can add seconds of load time to a page, and if that burden is fully on the client (website visitor), then they could get frustrated and leave your site.\n  CSR\u0026rsquo;s effect on search engine bots: For example, Googlebot has something called a second wave of indexing. In this process, they crawl and index the HTML of a page first, then come back to render the JavaScript when resources become available. This two-phased approach means that sometimes, JavaScript content might be missed, and not included in Google’s index (see “What is render budget?” for more information). Other search engines are worse at rendering JavaScript than Google.\n  JavaScript can also slow search engine bots down while they’re crawling a website, which on large sites, can introduce crawl budget issues.\nWhat is SSR  The site will be ready with the final intended HTML (all rendered) when it reaches over internet from server to client. Any JS that has to run, executes on Server and HTML is created.  Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js provide SSR capabilities.\nWhat are the benefits of server-side rendering? Because JavaScript is rendered on the website’s server, both\n search engine bots, and humans get a faster page experience.  This not only means a better UX (which is also part of Google’s ranking algorithm), but it also eliminates speed-related crawl budget issues.\nSending fully-rendered pages to search engine bots also means that you’re not risking the “partial indexing” that can happen with client-side rendered content. When Google and other search engine bots try to access your page, instead of having to wait for rendering resources to become available before seeing your full page, they’ll get the fully-rendered page right from the get-go.\nWhat are the risks of server-side rendering?  Server-side rendering can be expensive and resource-intensive.  Expensive: because the full burden of rendering your content for bots and human website visitors is on your servers. Resource-intensive to implement: since it’s not the default for JavaScript websites and will require work from your engineering team to execute.    Server-side rendering also tends not to work with third-party JavaScript. So, if you use services like Bazaarvoice to pull in reviews on your website, they won’t be rendered with server-side rendering.\nWhy SSR is better for SEO  bots get full HTML when crawling. UX is better - its one of the params for better ranking.  Third approach - Dynamic Rendering  SSR for search engine bots, CSR in all other cases.\n  Send a fully rendered page to search engine bot when it tries to access the page. When a human tries to access the same page, their browser has to render the page.
