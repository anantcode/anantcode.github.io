Create a folder images in public also create public/images/posts to store images of your post.\nCreate a frontmatter - it is always at the top In the test md file,\nGet post on homepage from md: getStaticProps() allows us to fetch data at build time - we can use this to create static website - use this to fetch data for static website.\nIn index.js\nexport async function getStaticProps() {  // here data can even come from strapi etc.(any headless CMS)  return {  props: { posts: \u0026#34;The Posts\u0026#34; }, //test  }; } getStaticProps() makes it available in the main component: (here in Home functional component)\nImport fs Although as soon as you add the import\nimport fs from \u0026#34;fs\u0026#34;; You will see error by Next\nReason for the error is - fs is not something you can import on the client side. fs is the filesystem node.js module and we are trying to import it in client side code (react code).\nHowever next.js is smart enough to know that if you use the fs module inside the getStaticProps() which will run on Server Side, then fs will work.\nNo more errors! :) Even if import fs from \u0026quot;fs\u0026quot; is still in code, fs was used only inside getStaticProps() function and hence the error is no longer shown by Next.\n1 = array of all files (names?) on posts directory.\n2 = 3, they are same.\n Create an array that will contain all the slugs. ~15:00 mins in https://youtu.be/MrjeefD8sac?t=895\n(For now there is only 1 test.md - its slug)\nUse gray-matter import matter from \u0026#34;gray-matter\u0026#34;; in getStaticProps()\n// destructring - renaming the data to frontmatter. const { data: **frontmatter** } = matter(markdownWithMeta);  return {  slug,  **frontmatter**, }; Now return the posts instead of test string, from getStaticProps()\nreturn {  props: { posts: posts }, }; we are logging it in component start\nSo for log at line 7, we see:\nwhy array? because its result of map()\nAlso array size = no. of files. We have only 1 test.md :\n Notice that we dont have the body of markdown - we dont need it because we will not put it in index.js but will do in another component.\n Add some more .md files see them getting displayed.\nCreate a component for post, instead of the h3 Added links to Post component\nIt is redirecting to the URL (but getting 404 ofcourse, we dont have those pages yet).\nNeed to work on inner page now. We wants url of the blog page to be like /blog/slug\nSince this is a static site, we need to create these paths at build time obviously. They way we will do that with specific data fetching method called getStaticPaths\nWe wants url of the blog page to be like /blog/slug and slug can be anything. So we have to format the pages like following, for routing:\nSo starting:\n Create a new folder blog under pages/ Create a js file under blog [slug].js It is named with because we want to be dynamic.

All other pages are also rendered by the JS by modifying DOM in the same page(hence Single Page Application)  Client-side rendering means that a website’s JavaScript is rendered in your browser, rather than on the website’s server.\nWhat are the benefits of client-side rendering?  As all the burden of rendering content is on the client (i.e. person or bot trying to view your page), Client-side rendering is the cheaper option for the website owner because it reduces the load on their own servers.  What are the risks of client-side rendering?   Client-side rendering can in general increase chances of a poor user experience. It is because JS can add seconds of load time to a page, and if that burden is fully on the client (website visitor), then they could get frustrated and leave your site.\n  CSR\u0026rsquo;s effect on search engine bots: For example, Googlebot has something called a second wave of indexing. In this process, they crawl and index the HTML of a page first, then come back to render the JavaScript when resources become available. This two-phased approach means that sometimes, JavaScript content might be missed, and not included in Google’s index (see “What is render budget?” for more information). Other search engines are worse at rendering JavaScript than Google.\n  JavaScript can also slow search engine bots down while they’re crawling a website, which on large sites, can introduce crawl budget issues.\nWhat is SSR  The site will be ready with the final intended HTML (all rendered) when it reaches over internet from server to client. Any JS that has to run, executes on Server and HTML is created.  Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js provide SSR capabilities.\nWhat are the benefits of server-side rendering? Because JavaScript is rendered on the website’s server, both\n search engine bots, and humans get a faster page experience.  This not only means a better UX (which is also part of Google’s ranking algorithm), but it also eliminates speed-related crawl budget issues.\nSending fully-rendered pages to search engine bots also means that you’re not risking the “partial indexing” that can happen with client-side rendered content. When Google and other search engine bots try to access your page, instead of having to wait for rendering resources to become available before seeing your full page, they’ll get the fully-rendered page right from the get-go.\nWhat are the risks of server-side rendering?  Server-side rendering can be expensive and resource-intensive.  Expensive: because the full burden of rendering your content for bots and human website visitors is on your servers. Resource-intensive to implement: since it’s not the default for JavaScript websites and will require work from your engineering team to execute.    Server-side rendering also tends not to work with third-party JavaScript. So, if you use services like Bazaarvoice to pull in reviews on your website, they won’t be rendered with server-side rendering.\nWhy SSR is better for SEO  bots get full HTML when crawling. UX is better - its one of the params for better ranking.  Third approach - Dynamic Rendering  SSR for search engine bots, CSR in all other cases.\n  Send a fully rendered page to search engine bot when it tries to access the page. When a human tries to access the same page, their browser has to render the page.
